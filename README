This is where all the code for the ironfeedback project resides.

The project, so far, contains:
 - a URL to accept JSON POST requests that happen at WP form submission time. It then processes and adds a customer to a SMS time based queue.
 - a helper function to use Nexmo API to send SMS to customers
 - a command to process the queue and send SMS to customers once scheduled time has passed.
